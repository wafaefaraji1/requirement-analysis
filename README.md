Requirement Analysis in Software Development
📘 Introduction

This repository, requirement-analysis, explores one of the most essential phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Requirement Analysis.
It serves as a foundational guide to understanding how to identify, document, and validate software requirements to ensure the successful development of a system.

🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying and documenting what a system should do — its functionalities, features, and constraints — before development begins.
It acts as a bridge between clients, stakeholders, and the development team to ensure everyone has a clear understanding of the project’s goals.

✨ Importance in SDLC

It prevents miscommunication between the client and the developer.

It ensures the system aligns with business needs.

It helps avoid costly changes during later stages of development.

💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Clarity and Understanding:
It provides a clear picture of what the software should achieve, reducing confusion.

Resource Optimization:
Helps in proper planning, resource allocation, and time estimation.

Minimized Risks and Errors:
Early identification of issues prevents rework and project delays.

Customer Satisfaction:
Ensures the final product meets user expectations and needs.

🧩 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Gathering:
Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observation.

Requirement Elicitation:
Extracting and understanding needs from stakeholders to identify hidden or unclear requirements.

Requirement Documentation:
Writing the collected requirements in a structured format, often using tools like SRS (Software Requirement Specification).

Requirement Analysis and Modeling:
Analyzing requirements to ensure feasibility, and modeling them using diagrams like Use Case or Data Flow Diagrams.

Requirement Validation:
Reviewing and verifying requirements with stakeholders to confirm they reflect their expectations.

⚙️ Types of Requirements
🧾 Functional Requirements

These describe what the system should do — its specific behaviors, actions, and functions.

Examples (for a Booking Management System):

Users can search for available rooms.

Users can book and cancel reservations.

The system should send confirmation emails upon booking.

🧱 Non-Functional Requirements

These describe how the system performs certain operations — quality attributes like performance, security, and usability.

Examples:

The system should respond within 2 seconds after a user submits a booking.

The system should be available 99.9% of the time.

Data should be encrypted during payment processing.

🎭 Use Case Diagrams
🧩 What is a Use Case Diagram?

A Use Case Diagram visually represents the interaction between actors (users or systems) and the use cases (functionalities) they perform.
It helps developers and stakeholders understand the system’s scope and interactions at a glance.

🧠 Benefits:

Simplifies complex requirements visually.

Identifies key system functionalities.

Improves communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
🧩 Definition

Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and accepted by the client.
They ensure that each requirement is testable and measurable.

💡 Importance

They help developers know when a feature is “done.”

They provide clear validation points for QA testers.

They reduce misunderstanding between clients and developers.

🛒 Example: Checkout Feature in Booking System

Feature: Checkout process for booking payment.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user can review booking details before payment.

The system supports multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

Payment confirmation is sent via email within 1 minute.

Booking status changes to “Confirmed” after successful payment.

If payment fails, the system displays an error and keeps the booking pending.
